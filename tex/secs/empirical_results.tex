	Following \citeA{stock1988probability, stock&watson1989indexes}, we take data on Industrial Production (IP), total personal income less transfer payments (GMYXP), total manufacturing and trade sales (MT82), and employee-hours in non-agricultural
	tablishment (LPMHU). Note that in their first paper \citeyear{stock1988probability} they use employes on non agricultural payrols.  The reason of this change is to following Moore's (1988) recommendation. Because of over time and part-timework, employee-hours measures more directly fluctuations in labour input than does the number of employees. Hence, our results are goning to be different from those of \citeA{stock1988probability} for that reason. Data has been downloaded in Stock's \href{https://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/publi.html}{webpage}.  %Note that my data is different from those used by \citeA{stock&watson1989indexes}. I am taking data from 2014-12-15 to 2022-08-31.

	\subsection{Preliminary analysis}
	
	The first step in specifying the model is to test for whether the series are integrated and, if they are, whether they are cointegrated.  As in \citeA{stock1988probability, stock&watson1989indexes}, for each of the the coincident indicators, \citeA{dickey1979distribution} test for a unit root (against the alternative that the series are stationary, perhaps around a linear time trend) was unable to reject (at the 10\% level) the hypothesis that the series are integrated. P-values are reported in Table \ref{tab:df_pvalues}.

		\input{tab/pvalues_adf}
	\end{table}
 
	The subsequent aplication of the \citeA{engle1987co} test of the nul hypothesis that the four series are not cointegrated against the alternative of cointegration failed to reject at the 10\% significance level. Thus these tests provided no evidence against the hypothesis that each series is integrated but they are not cointegrated. I therefore estimated the model using for the first diference of the logarithm of each of the coincident series, standardized to have zero mean and unit variance.

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

The parameters of the single-index model have been estimated using IP, DPI, TS and AW over the periods 1959:2-1983:12. As in \citeA{stock&watson1989indexes}, a second order autoregressive  specification  has been adopted for $\Delta C_t$, so that $p=2$. Also, errors $u_t$ are modelled as an $AR(2)$, i.e., $k=2$. I have followed \citeA{stock1988probability} and considered $\gamma$ to be constant, i.e., $\gamma = \gamma_0\in\R^4$. The loglikelihood for this model is 274.819. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the single-index model are presented in Tables  he maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the single-index model are presented in Table \ref{tab:ml-params1}. I have follow \citeA{gupta1974computational} for maximising the log likelihood.The basic idea is that the negative log likelihood is minimised by the Newton-Raphson Method, iterating the process until the log likelihood stabilises. Standard errors are computed as the square root of the diagonal of the (approximated) Hessian matrix of $\mathcal{L}$.

\input{tab/params}
The CEI, $C_{t|t}$,  is is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:cei}. Notice that  $C_{t|t} = [Z_c \ 0 \ 1] \hat{\alpha}_{t|t}$. I have also included a 5\% confidence interval band measured by $C_{t|t}\pm 1.96 \sqrt{\hat{P}_{t|t}}$, where $\hat{P}_{t|t} = [Z_c \ 0 \ 1] \hat{\alpha}_{t|t}[Z_c \ 0 \ 1]^{\text{\tiny T}}$.
