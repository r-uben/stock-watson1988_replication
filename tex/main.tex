	\maketitle
	This model was proposed by \citeA{stock1988probability}  formalises the idea that  the reference cycle is best measured  by looking at co-movements  across several aggregate time series rather than just a single variable, like GDP or  GNP. Importantly, we are here talking about one single but unobserved variable, ``the state of the economy'', denoted here by $C_t$, which can be proxied, according to \cite{stock1988probability, stock&watson1989indexes}, by the experimental~CEI.
	
	An important assumption here is that each roughly coincident series has a component that is attributable to the single unobserved variable and a component which is unique  (idosyncratic component), with all of the idiosyncratic omponents of each observed variable being uncorrelated. Those idiosyncratic components are also assumed to be uncorrelated with $C_t$ at all leads and lags. Our goal here is thus to study an ``unobserved single index" or ```dynamic factor" model. The methodology would be using the Kalman Filter.
