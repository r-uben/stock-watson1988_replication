# Replication of Stock &amp Watson (1988)

This is a replication of Stock &am Watson's (1988) paper. Essentially, I construct the parametric "single-index" model in which the state of the economy
is an unobserved variable common to multiple agregate time series. That index belongs to the class of Coincident Economic Indicators (CEI). Data for the replication is provided directly by Mark W. Watson and can be found in his [website](https://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/publi.html).
